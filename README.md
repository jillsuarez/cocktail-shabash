# cocktail-shabash
## Introduction

Cocktail-Shabash is an application designed to rectify the coordination problem a user faces when trying to design an at-home date night. The user in question is presented with a button, properly coined the “Shabash” button, which will sort through a list of options from CocktailDB and MovieDB to produce a randomly assigned pairing of a cocktail and movie. If the user is displeased with their presented option, the user can simply reshuffle their options by clicking the “Shabash” button for (in theory) infinite combinations.

## Built With: 

HTML
CSS
Javascript

The combination of HTML and CSS allowed for seamless structure and design, while Javascript was the ideal environment for API implementation in conjunction with the use of local storage, so the user can provide feedback on their drink/movie combination. 

## Challenges

Initially, this project sought to remedy this circumstance of a user who had leftover drinks from a recent soiree and wanted to know how those remaining ingredients could be combined to produce a cocktail of the user’s liking. However, upon further API research, our team found that not only would the API we were working with be unable to provide that information for free, but the design itself would be too complex given our present time constraints. 

This revelation thrust us back to the drawing board where we were able to come up with our date night application paired down to its most concise elements (MVP) that you see depicted in the application: the Shabash button, the drink and movie display, and the comment section. 

## Requirements

## Project Status 

The version of the application that is publicly available is designed to fulfill the basic functions of the MVP. In the future, we would like to expand on this application by implementing the following innovations: 

1. Expanded options for possible cocktails.
2. Expanded options for possible movies.
3. Providing the recipe instructions below the cocktail image and name. 
4. Providing the platform where the movie can be viewed beneath the movie image and name.
